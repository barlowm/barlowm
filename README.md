# Who Am I
Ok, like most people I'm not great at these things so based on the ideas provided here I'll give it a shot.
- ðŸ”­ Currently Technical Architect for several projects for the Program Management Office of the Dept. of Veterans Affairs
- ðŸ“« [Personal Email](mailto:barlowm@gmail.com?subject=Read%20your%20GitHub%20profile...&body=and%20would%20like%20to%20discuss%20something%20with%20you...) is probably the best way (though I am on several slack and discord groups as well and you can find me there under the name "MikeB")
- âš¡ Fun fact: I have been asked and told that I resemble a "jolly old elf" and that is for a good reason, I AM Santa Claus (in disguise *wink*)

If you want to learn more about my technical background I have a [brief resume](https://github.com/barlowm/barlowm/blob/master/m.barlow-resume-Sept2020.pdf) on here as well.

Thanks
